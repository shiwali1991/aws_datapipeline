# aws_datapipeline

This was done for a hypothetical company named "Gans" introduced by my instructors to learn some data engineering concepts. The company was e-scooter based start-up aiming to expand in Europe. They basically required data about population of different cities, flight data as the e-scooters were used a lot by backpack tourists as well. And weather data as well because the usage gets interrupted or enhanced depending upon weather conditions. After storing it locally in a database, it was required of us to connect to cloud database and run the code scripts on the cloud as well to get real time data scheduled daily. I used the following to get the data: web scraping, APIs, Rapid APIs and AWS cloud service. The elaborate details could be read on the medium article that i wrote for this project.
